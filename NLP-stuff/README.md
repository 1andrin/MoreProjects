Current Files:

-> Main file is the Dow Jones Factiva scraper ("FactivaScraper.ipynb"), which I initially created for an academic research project related to the climate related sentiment towards banks. The file was later used (updated version) to collect articles for a 5-week-long project competition organized by a student society. The complete project repo with all contributors can be found here: https://github.com/adamzbikowski/Twitter-Acquisition-Sentiment-Analysis.
